I’ve been dreaming 
friendly faces
I’ve got so much time to kill
 
just imagine 
people laughing
I know some day we will
 
and even if it’s far away
get me through another day
 
cover me in sunshine
shower me with good times
tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning 
and everything’ll be alright
cover me in sunshine
 
from a distance 
all these mountains
are just some tiny hills
